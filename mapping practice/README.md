# Mapping

This is a sample Spring Boot application that demonstrates the usage of Lombok, and MySQL in a Spring Boot project. The application showcases the relationships between various entities, such as `Student`, `Laptop`, `Course`, `Book`, and `Address`, and how they can be managed using Spring Boot and MySQL.

## Frameworks and Libraries Used

- **Spring Boot**: A framework built on top of the Spring framework, providing rapid application development features for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **Lombok**: A library that helps reduce boilerplate code by automatically generating common Java code, such as getters, setters, constructors, and more.
- **Hibernate Validation**: A validation framework that integrates with Spring Boot to provide easy and flexible validation of data.
- **MySQL**: A popular relational database management system used for storing and managing data.

## Project Structure

The project follows a typical Spring Boot project structure. The main classes and packages include:

- `com.mappingpractice.mappings`: The root package of the application.
- `com.mappingpractice.mappings.model`: Contains the entity classes representing the data models, including `Student`, `Laptop`, `Course`, `Book`, and `Address`.
- `com.mappingpractice.mappings.repository`: Provides the repository interfaces for data access, such as `StudentRepository`, `LaptopRepository`, `CourseRepository`, and `BookRepository`.
- `com.mappingpractice.mappings.service`: Contains the service classes that handle the business logic and interact with the repositories, such as `StudentService`, `LaptopService`, `CourseService`, and `BookService`.
- `com.mappingpractice.mappings.controller`: Contains the controller classes that handle HTTP requests and responses, such as `StudentController`, `LaptopController`, `CourseController`, and `BookController`.

## Database Configuration

The application is configured to use a MySQL database. To configure the database connection, open the `application.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory. Update the following properties with your MySQL database connection details:

Certainly! Here's an updated version of the README.md file that includes CRUD operations for all the entities:

## Database Configuration

The application is configured to use a MySQL database. To configure the database connection, open the `application.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory. Update the following properties with your MySQL database connection details:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase
spring.datasource.username=username
spring.datasource.password=password


## Usage

To run the application, you can use an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or execute the following command in the project directory:


The application will start and listen on the default port `8080`.

## Endpoints

The application exposes RESTful API endpoints for managing the entities. Here are the main endpoints for each entity:

### Student

- `GET /students`: Retrieves a list of all students.
- `GET /students/{id}`: Retrieves a student by ID.
- `POST /students`: Creates a new student.
- `PUT /students/{id}`: Updates an existing student.
- `DELETE /students/{id}`: Deletes a student by ID.

### Laptop

- `GET /laptops`: Retrieves a list of all laptops.
- `GET /laptops/{id}`: Retrieves a laptop by ID.
- `POST /laptops`: Creates a new laptop.
- `PUT /laptops/{id}`: Updates an existing laptop.
- `DELETE /laptops/{id}`: Deletes a laptop by ID.

### Course

- `GET /courses`: Retrieves a list of all courses.
- `GET /courses/{id}`: Retrieves a course by ID.
- `POST /courses`: Creates a new course.
- `PUT /courses/{id}`: Updates an existing course.
- `DELETE /courses/{id}`: Deletes a course by ID.

### Book

- `GET /books`: Retrieves a list of all books.
- `GET /books/{id}`: Retrieves a book by ID.
- `POST /books`: Creates a new book.
- `PUT /books/{id}`: Updates an existing book.
- `DELETE /books/{id}`: Deletes a book by ID.

You can use tools like cURL, Postman, or Swagger UI to interact with these endpoints and perform CRUD operations on the respective entities.
