## Frameworks and Language Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for developing the application.
- **Spring Boot**: A framework built on top of the Spring framework, providing rapid application development features for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **Maven**: A build automation tool and dependency management tool used for managing the project's dependencies and building the application.
- **Hibernate**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework used for mapping Java objects to database tables and vice versa.

## Dataflow

The user management system follows the following data flow:

1. **Client Interaction**: The client, such as a web browser or a mobile app, sends HTTP requests to the server for user management operations, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting users (CRUD operations).

2. **Controller Layer**: In the Spring Boot application, the incoming HTTP requests are handled by the Controller layer. The Controller receives the requests and delegates them to the appropriate methods in the service layer.

3. **Service Layer**: The Service layer contains the business logic of the application and handles user management operations. When a request is received from the Controller, the Service layer performs the necessary actions. For example, when creating a new user, the Service layer validates the input data, generates a unique identifier, and interacts with the data access layer.

4. **Data Access Layer**: The Data Access layer is responsible for interacting with the underlying database to perform CRUD operations on the user data. It uses Hibernate to map Java objects to database tables and execute SQL queries.

5. **Database**: The database stores the user data. It can be any relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or H2.

6. **Response**: After the data operation is completed, the response flows back through the layers in the reverse order. The Service layer receives the response from the Data Access layer, performs any necessary post-processing or formatting, and sends it back to the Controller.

7. **Controller Response**: The Controller layer receives the response from the Service layer and returns an appropriate HTTP response to the client, indicating the success or failure of the requested operation.

## Data Structure

1. **User Model**: The User model represents the data structure for storing user information. It typically includes attributes such as userId, username, email, password, etc.

## Project Summary

The User Management System is designed to manage user information and perform CRUD operations on user data. It provides a RESTful API for interacting with users. The application is built using Spring Boot, making it easy to deploy and run as a standalone service.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Java and Maven installed.
3. Set up the database according to the configuration in the application properties file.
4. Run the application using Maven or your preferred IDE.
5. Access the API endpoints using tools like Postman or your web browser.

## Database

The User Management System uses a H2 database to store user data. The type of database can be configured in the application properties file. By default, it is set to use H2, an in-memory database, for ease of testing and development. However, for production deployment, you should use a more robust database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
